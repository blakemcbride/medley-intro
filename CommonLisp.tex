@chapter Common Lisp

The Common Lisp currently supported by Medley is somewhere between
CLtl1 and CLtl2.  There is an ongoing effort to move it to ANSI
Common Lisp.

As mentioned previously, in Medley Common Lisp and Interlisp are fully
integrated.  From within Common Lisp, Interlisp functions may be
accessed through the Common Lisp package named ``IL''.
