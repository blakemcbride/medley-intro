@chapter Common Lisp

The Common Lisp currently supported by Medley is somewhere between
CLtl1 and CLtl2.  There is an ongoing effort to complete the move to
CLtl2.

As mentioned previously, in Medley Common Lisp and Interlisp are fully
integrated.  From within Common Lisp, Interlisp functions may be
accessed through the Common Lisp package nicknamed ``IL''.
